# Idea 0 - Goal to 365

Hi, Iâ€™m Stanton and I am a futurist who is very interested in topics around the environment, education, healthcare, society, and money. I am embarking on a project to write out 365 ideas that I believe can help make individuals or the world a better place with the goal of publishing one idea a day. 

These ideas might not necessarily be good and this project is more for practice than anything else. But who knows, some might actually pan out to be something interesting.
