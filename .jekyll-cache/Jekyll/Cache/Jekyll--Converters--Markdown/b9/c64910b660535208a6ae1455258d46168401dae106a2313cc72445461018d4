I"š<p>Iâ€™ve been wanting to get into the habit writing for a long time because I think written communication is a very valuable skill to have. A daily habit of writing would help me improve my writing ability and it will also give me an outlet for the tons of ideas I want to share. I havenâ€™t because Iâ€™m lazy, scared, and am a perfectionist. These are all just excuses. Being lazy means that I havenâ€™t made this a priority. Being scared means Iâ€™m afraid of how people see me if I put myself out there. And the perfectionist excuse is just a little bit of both being lazy and scared,</p>

<p>So starting today, Iâ€™ll be writing a short piece every day. These will be random ramblings of topics that I have encountered the day of or have been thinking about. To make sure I can get these out every day, the rule is to try and keep each piece short.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ll start by posting these on WeChat and Facebook. If you like it, give me a like. If you have thoughts, comments, questions, grammar suggestions, or critiques, give me a comment.</p>

<p>Tomorrowâ€™s piece will be an honest introduction of me and what kind of topics Iâ€™ll be covering. Thanks for reading!</p>
